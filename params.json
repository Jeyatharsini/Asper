{"name":"Asper","tagline":"Esper for Android","body":"### Howdy !\r\nEsper is an open sourced, complex event processing engine for the Java, and .NET plattform. Complex event processing delivers high-speed processing of many events across all the layers of an organization, identifying the most meaningful events within the event cloud, analyzing their impact, and taking subsequent action in real time. Esper offers a SQL like language for processing events and enables dealing with high frequency time-based event data.\r\n\r\nSome typical examples of applications are:\r\n\r\nBusiness process management and automation (process monitoring, BAM, reporting exceptions, operational intelligence)\r\nFinance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection, risk management)\r\nNetwork and application monitoring (intrusion detection, SLA monitoring)\r\nSensor network applications (RFID reading, scheduling and control of fabrication lines, air traffic)\r\nIt has until now been difficult to utilize Esper on Mobile devices due to dependency restrictions from missing java packages and classes in Android. We have resolved these dependencies by utilizing packages from the OpenJDK project and by modifying existing JavaBeans classes to fit within our context without the need for java.awt.*\r\n\r\nThis version is based upon Esper 4.9.0, released in Mars 2013.
